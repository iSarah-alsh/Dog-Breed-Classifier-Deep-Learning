# Dog-Breed-Classifier-Deep-Learning
Convolutional Neural Networks

# Project Overview:
This is Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree program of Udacity. In this project I learned how to develop algorithm that processe real-world images supplied by users and it's could be used as a web or mobile application. My algorithm identifies dog image that supplied by user into it's breed, and if the user supply a human image the algorithm identifies the resembling dog breed. 

For Example:

# Project Information:
## Contents

- Step 0: Import Datasets 
- Step 1: Detect Humans 
- Step 2: Detect Dogs 
- Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch) 
- Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning) 
- Step 5: Write your Algorithm 
- Step 6: Test Your Algorithm

## Main CNN Model:
I had tried the pre-trained model (VGG-16) in step 3 and in step 4 for the transfer learning.

**VGG-16:**
is a convolutional Neural Network model that achieves 92.7% accuracy in ImageNet which roposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman from the University of Oxford in the paper (Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition).
*Paper: https://paperswithcode.com/paper/very-deep-convolutional-networks-for-large

**The Architecture**
- Five convolutional blocks (2D conv.)
- 3 x 3 reseptive filed.
- ReLU as Activation function .
- Max Pooling.
- Classifier function:
- 3 FC layers at the top of the network.

## Dataset:
In this project used ImageNet. It is a dataset of over 15 million labeled high-resolution images belonging to roughly 22,000 categories.

# Libraries 

The list below represents main libraries and its objects for the project.

- PyTorch (Convolutional Neural Network).
- OpenCV (Human Face Detection).
- Matplotlib (Plot Images).
- Numpy. 


# Accelerating the traing process:
In the training step in the Step 3 and 4, it is taking too long to run so you will need to either reduce the complexity of the VGG-16 architecture or switch to running the code on a GPU.

You can use **Amazon Web Services** to launch an EC2 GPU instance. (**But this costs money!**)
